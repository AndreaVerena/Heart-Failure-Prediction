# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Welcome to my repository. 
The aim of this document is to purpose a solution to the heart failure prediction problem, using Machine Learning tools. The data consists in thirteen clinical features, twelve of them corresponds to possible predictors, and the last one is the target, this is, death event or no death event. The data can be find at UCI repositori: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records

The description of the clinical features are:
* age: age of the patient (years)
* anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
* high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)
* creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
* diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)
* ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
* platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
* sex: woman or man (binary)
* serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
* serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
* smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean)
* time: follow-up period (days)
[target] death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
