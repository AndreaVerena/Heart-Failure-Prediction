# Heart Failure Prediction
Welcome to my repository.

The aim of this document is to propose a solution to the heart failure prediction problem using Machine Learning tools. The data consists of thirteen clinical features, with twelve of them corresponding to possible predictors, and the last one being the target, which is a death event or no death event. The data can be found at the UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records

The description of the clinical features is as follows:
* age: age of the patient (years)
* anaemia: decrease in red blood cells or haemoglobin (boolean)
* high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)
* creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
* diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)
* ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
* platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
* sex: woman or man (binary)
* serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
* serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
* smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean)
* time: follow-up period (days)
* [target] death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
